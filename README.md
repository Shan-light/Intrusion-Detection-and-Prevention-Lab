# Intrusion-Detection-and-Prevention-Lab
Suricata was install and configure on a MARS Kali Linux environment to act as both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Protection System (IPS).

## Objective
Install and configure Suricata on a Kali Linux system.

Demonstrate and understand the difference between IDS and IPS modes of suricata.

Gain practical experience in network traffic monitoring, rule configuration, and alert generation.

Simulate real-world intrusion scenarios to observe how Suricata detects and prevents threats in real-time.

### Skills Learned
- Network Security Fundamentals - Understanding core concepts of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Passive and active network monitoring
- Suricata Installation and Configuration - Installing Suricata on a Kali Linux environment
- Configuring Suricata to operate in IDS and IPS modes
- Managing Suricata rule sets and YAML configuration files
- Traffic Analysis and Threat Detection - analyzing real-time network traffic, Suricata logs and alerts
- Identify malicious activity based on predefined rule sets
- Linux System Administration - Editing system config files with vim, nano, or other CLI editors
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
